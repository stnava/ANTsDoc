  abstract = {Results from functional imaging studies are often still interpreted
	using the classical architectonic brain maps of Brodmann and his
	successors. One obvious weakness in traditional, architectural mapping
	is the subjective nature of localizing borders between cortical areas
	by means of a purely visual, microscopical examination of histological
	specimens. To overcome this limitation, objective mapping procedures
	based on quantitative cytoarchitecture have been generated. As a
	result, new maps for various species including man were established.
	In our contribution, principles of quantitative cytoarchitecture
	and algorithm-based cortical mapping are described for a cytoarchitectural
	parcellation of the human auditory cortex. Defining cortical borders
	based on quantified changes in cortical lamination is the decisive
	step towards a novel, highly improved probabilistic brain atlas.},

  abstract = {Normative data on the in vivo size of the human brain and its major
	anatomically defined subdivisions are not readily available. In this
	study, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure
	regional brain volumes in 46 normal, right-handed adults (23 men,
	23 women) between the ages of 22-49 years. Parcellation of the brain
	was based on neuroanatomical landmarks. The following brain regions
	were measured: the cerebral hemispheres, frontal lobe, temporal lobe,
	parietal lobe, occipital lobe, cingulate gyrus, insula, cerebellum,
	corpus callosum, and lateral ventricles. Males tend to be significantly
	larger than females, for the whole brain and for nearly all of its
	major subdivisions, including the corpus callosum. However, the proportional
	sizes of regions relative to total volume of the hemisphere are remarkably
	similar in males and females. Variation in size of region is always
	greater than variation in proportional representation. Asymmetries
	in brain regions are not profound, with the exception of the cingulate
	gyrus, which is larger in the left hemisphere. Brain regions are
	highly correlated in size, with the exception of the lateral ventricles.
	After controlling for hemisphere size, the volumes of the frontal
	and parietal lobes are significantly negatively correlated. The occipital
	lobe tends to be less sexually dimorphic than other major lobes,
	and less correlated with other brain regions for volume. These results
	have implications for understanding whether or not certain sectors
	of the brain have shown relative expansion over the course of hominid
	and hominoid evolution.},

	gray and white matter (GM, WM) volumes of the frontal, temporal,

	Subjects included 23 male and 23 female healthy, right-handed subjects.
	For all structures, male volumes were greater than female, but the
	gray/white (G/W) ratio was consistently higher across structures
	in women than men. Sexual dimorphism was greater for WM than GM:
	most of the G/W ratio sex differences can be attributed to variation
	in WM volume. The corpus callosum, although larger in men, is less
	sexually dimorphic than the WM as a whole. Several regions demonstrate
	pair-wise asymmetries in G/W ratio and WM volume. Both the cingulate
	gyrus and insula exhibit strong asymmetries. The left cingulate gyrus
	is significantly larger than the right, and the G/W ratio of the

	statistically significant sex differences and asymmetries are present
	at this level of analysis, we argue that researchers should be wary

	ventilation defects were more numerous and larger in the two symptomatic

	This same subject was studied before and after bronchodilator therapy,
	and all ventilation defects resolved after therapy. Hyperpolarized

  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {This paper is about warping a brain image from one subject (the object
	image) so that it matches another (the template image). A high-dimensional
	model is used, whereby a finite element approach is employed to estimate
	translations at the location of each voxel in the template image.
	Bayesian statistics are used to obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP)
	estimate of the deformation field. The validity of any registration
	method is largely based upon the constraints or, in this instance,
	priors incorporated into the model describing the transformations.
	In this approach we assume that the priors should have some form
	of symmetry, in that priors describing the probability distribution
	of the deformations should be identical to those for the inverses
	(i.e., warping brain A to brain B should not be different probabilistically
	from warping B to A). The fundamental assumption is that the probability
	of stretching a voxel by a factor of n is considered to be the same
	as the probability of shrinking n voxels by a factor of n(-1). In
	the Bayesian framework adopted here, the priors are assumed to have
	a Gibbs form, where the Gibbs potential is a penalty function that
	embodies this symmetry. The penalty function of choice is based upon
	the singular values of the Jacobian having a lognormal distribution.
	This enforces a continuous one-to-one mapping. A gradient descent
	algorithm is presented that incorporates the above priors in order
	to obtain a MAP estimate of the deformations. We demonstrate this
	approach for the two-dimensional case, but the principles can be
	extended to three dimensions. A number of examples are given to demonstrate
	how the method works.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for brain-tissue classification
	in magnetic resonance (MR) images that relies on a very general,
	adaptive statistical model of image neighborhoods. The method models
	MR-tissue intensities as derived from stationary random fields. It
	models the associated Markov statistics nonparametrically via a data-driven
	strategy. This paper describes the essential theoretical aspects
	underpinning adaptive, nonparametric Markov modeling and the theory
	behind the consistency of such a model. This general formulation
	enables the method to easily adapt to various kinds of MR images
	and the associated acquisition artifacts. It implicitly accounts
	for the intensity nonuniformity and performs reasonably well on T1-weighted
	MR data without nonuniformity correction. The method minimizes an
	information-theoretic metric on the probability density functions
	associated with image neighborhoods to produce an optimal classification.
	It automatically tunes its important internal parameters based on
	the information content of the data. Combined with an atlas-based
	initialization, it is completely automatic. Experiments on real,
	simulated, and multimodal data demonstrate the advantages of the
	method over the current state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms
	on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate
	energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization
	literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different
	polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however,
	has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision.
	The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of
	the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in
	vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms,
	as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms
	we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push-relabel" methods
	and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths."
	We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the
	contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many
	cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the
	other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation
	of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research
	purposes.},

	achieved by applying sinc-modulated RF-pulse trains along the frequency-

	low-angle shot (FLASH)-based acquisition at inspiration and expiration.
	The displacement vectors, first and second principal strains, and

	lower region were significantly greater than those in either the
	middle or upper region (P < 0.005), while there were no significant
	differences between the three regions for the two principal strains
	and quantitative ventilation (P = 0.11-0.92). Variations in principal

	using a hyperpolarized helium-3 (HP (3)He) magnetic resonance (MR)
	tagging technique. Methods and Materials: Three healthy volunteers
	underwent MR tagging studies after inhalation of 1 L HP (3)He gas
	diluted with nitrogen. Multiple-slice two-dimensional and volumetric
	three-dimensional MR tagged images of the lungs were obtained at
	end-inhalation and end-exhalation, and displacement vector maps were
	computed. Results: The grids of tag lines in the HP (3)He MR images
	were well defined at end-inhalation and remained evident at end-exhalation.
	Displacement vector maps clearly demonstrated the regional lung motion
	and deformation that occurred during exhalation. Discontinuity and
	differences in motion pattern between two adjacent lung lobes were
	readily resolved. Conclusions: Hyperpolarized helium-3 MR tagging
	technique can be used for direct in vivo measurement of respiratory
	lung motion on a regional basis. This technique may lend new insights
	into the regional pulmonary biomechanics and thus provide valuable
	information for the deformable registration of lung.},

	noninvasively image the motion and deformation of the heart in vivo,

	a novel and fully automated technique based on nonrigid image registration
	using multilevel free-form deformations (MFFDs) for the analysis
	of myocardial motion using tagged MRI. The novel aspect of our technique
	is its integrated nature for tag localization and deformation field
	reconstruction using image registration and voxel based similarity
	measures. To extract the motion field within the myocardium during
	systole we register a sequence of images taken during systole to
	a set of reference images taken at end-diastole, maximizing the normalized
	mutual information between the images. We use both short-axis and
	long-axis images of the heart to estimate the full four-dimensional
	motion field within the myocardium. We also present validation results

	is robust against anatomical variability and pathology. Starting
	from a set of samples generated from prior tissue probability maps
	(a 'model') in a standard, brain-based coordinate system ('stereotaxic
	space'), the method first reduces the fraction of incorrectly labeled
	samples in this set by using a minimum spanning tree graph-theoretic
	approach. Then, the corrected set of samples is used by a supervised
	kNN classifier for classifying the entire 3D image. The classification
	procedure is robust against variability in the image quality through
	a non-parametric implementation: no assumptions are made about the
	tissue intensity distributions. The performance of this brain tissue
	classification procedure is demonstrated through quantitative and
	qualitative validation experiments on both simulated MRI data (10
	subjects) and real MRI data (43 subjects). A significant improvement
	in output quality was observed on subjects who exhibit morphological
	deviations from the model due to aging and pathology.},

	is compared with existing rigid and affine registration methods.
	METHOD: Nonrigid registration was compared with rigid and affine
	registration methods and unregistered images using 54 gadolinium-enhanced
	3D breast MR data sets. Twenty-seven data sets had been previously
	reported normal, and 27 contained a histologically proven carcinoma.
	The comparison was based on visual assessment and ranking by two
	radiologists. RESULTS: When analyzed by two radiologists independently,
	all three registration methods gave better-quality subtraction images
	than unregistered images (p < 0.01), but nonrigid registration gave
	significantly better results than the rigid and affine registration
	methods (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between rigid
	and affine registration methods. CONCLUSION: Nonrigid registration
	significantly reduces the effects of movement artifact in subtracted
	contrast-enhanced breast MRI. This may enable better visualization
	of small tumors and those within a glandular breast.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current guideline for classifying asthma severity,
	the National Asthma Education Prevention Program (NAEPP) 2002, is
	not evidence-based. We had the opportunity to validate this guideline
	in an untreated inner-city population, both in those < or =5 and
	those >5 years of age. The basis for this retrospective validation
	model was to determine how well the NAEPP severity classification
	based on symptom-frequency criteria alone identified patients in
	those age groups demonstrating significant morbidity the previous
	year and thus the potential need for controller therapy. METHODS:
	Using a mobile asthma van (Breathmobile) at the school site, children
	not receiving controller medication were evaluated by an asthma specialist
	for severity according to NAEPP guideline clinical criteria. Validation
	was determined by the relationship of guideline severity to > or
	=2 emergency department (ED) visits, any hospitalization, health
	care utilization (any ED visit, hospitalization), number of exacerbations,
	and school absenteeism resulting from asthma the prior year. RESULTS:
	Eight hundred twenty-six asthmatic children were evaluated; 89 (10.8\%)
	were < or =2 years, 222 (26.9\%) were 3 to 5 years, and 515 (62.3\%)
	were >5 years of age; 60.5\% were male, and 80.9\% were Hispanic.
	Classification of asthma severity included 34.4\% with mild intermittent,
	10.2\% with mild persistent, 31.5\% with moderate persistent, and
	24.0\% with severe persistent asthma categories. There were significantly
	more Hispanic children and children < or =5 years classified as having
	mild intermittant asthma. Morbidity was clearly related to severity
	in the overall population. However, although the health care utilization
	was significantly related to severity, it was borderline in those
	3 to 5 years and nonsignificant in children < or =2 years. CONCLUSIONS:
	The NAEPP guidelines 2002, based on symptom-frequency criteria as
	assessed in this study, seem to offer a valid basis for classifying
	asthma severity in those >5 years of age but may underclassify younger
	children. Our data suggest that morbidity experienced in the prior
	year may provide a useful additional criterion for classifying asthma
	severity, particularly in those children < or =5 years of age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tagged MRI of the heart is difficult to implement clinically
	because of the lack of fast analytical techniques. We investigated
	the accuracy of harmonic phase (HARP) imaging for rapid quantification
	of myocardial strains and for detailed analysis of left ventricular
	(LV) function during dobutamine stimulation. METHODS AND RESULTS:
	Tagged MRI was performed in 10 volunteers at rest and during 5 to
	20 microg(-1). kg(-1). min(-1) dobutamine and in 9 postinfarct patients
	at rest. We compared 2D myocardial strains (circumferential shortening,
	Ecc; maximal shortening, E(2); and E(2), direction) as assessed by
	a conventional technique and by HARP. Full quantitative analysis
	of the data was 10 times faster with HARP. For pooled data, the regression
	coefficient was r=0.93 for each strain (P<0.001). In volunteers,
	Ecc and E(2) were greater in the free wall than in the septum (P<0.01),
	but recruitable myocardial strain at peak dobutamine was greater
	in the LV septum (P<0.01). E(2) orientation shifted away from the
	circumferential direction at peak dobutamine (P<0.01). HARP accurately
	detected subtle changes in myocardial strain fields under increasing
	doses of dobutamine. In patients, HARP-determined Ecc and E(2) values
	were dramatically reduced in the asynergic segments as compared with
	remote (P<0.001), and E(2) direction shifted away from the circumferential
	direction (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HARP MRI provides fast, accurate
	assessment of myocardial strains from tagged MR images in normal
	subjects and in patients with coronary artery disease with wall motion
	abnormalities. HARP correctly indexes dobutamine-induced changes
	in strains and has the potential for on-line quantitative monitoring
	of LV function during stress testing.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate
	a method for quantifying lung motion from the registration of successive
	images in serial magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions during normal
	respiration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of pulmonary motion
	were obtained by summing the normalized cross-correlation over serially
	acquired lung images to identify corresponding locations between
	the images. The estimated motions were modeled as deformations of
	an elastic body and thus reflect to a first order approximation the
	true physical behavior of lung parenchyma. The Lagrangian strain,
	derived from the calculated motion fields, were used to quantify
	the tissue deformation induced in the lung over the serial acquisition.
	RESULTS: The method was validated on a magnetic resonance imaging
	study, for which breath-hold images were acquired of a healthy volunteer
	at different phases of the respiratory cycle. Regional parenchymal
	strain was observed to be oriented toward the pulmonary hilum, with
	strain magnitude maximal at the midcycle of the expiratory phase.
	CONCLUSION: In vivo magnetic resonance imaging quantification of
	lung motion holds the potential of providing a new diagnostic dimension
	in the assessment of pulmonary function, augmenting the information
	provided by studies of ventilation and perfusion.},

	responsible for persistent maximum expiratory airflow limitation
	in nonsmoking patients with acute and chronic moderate to severe
	persistent asthma in comparison to chronic obstructive pulmonary
	disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The phenomenon of acute but reversible
	loss of lung elastic recoil during acute asthma is reviewed, although
	no plausible pathophysiologic explanation has been offered. Nonsmoking
	adults with stable asthma and persistent maximum expiratory airflow
	limitation, despite optimal polytherapy, were shown to have unsuspected
	and unexplained marked loss of lung elastic recoil in the absence
	of lung computed tomography scored emphysema. This condition resulted
	in up to 50\% reduction in maximum expiratory airflow. Furthermore,
	these patients remain at high risk for adverse clinical events, including
	near-fatal asthma. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reduction
	in maximum expiratory airflow is related to variable extent of loss
	of lung elastic recoil secondary to emphysema and concurrent intrinsic
	airway obstruction or obliteration of small airways. There is also
	an unexplained loss of lung elastic recoil in primary intrinsic small
	airways disease in the absence of emphysema. SUMMARY: Nonsmoking
	patients with moderate-severe persistent asthma and patients with
	smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease share similar
	physiologic mechanisms of expiratory airflow limitation, but probably
	caused by different anatomic abnormalities.},

	for fixed maximum expiratory airflow (max) limitation in patients
	with chronic persistent asthma. METHODS: When optimally treated and
	in clinically stable condition, we studied 21 asthmatic patients
	and classified them into three groups based on the severity of expiratory
	airflow limitation: (1) group A included 5 asthmatic patients (four
	women; mean +/- SD age, 51 +/- 17 years) with mild persistent asthma
	(FEV(1) > 80\% predicted) with serial FEV(1) measurements obtained
	prior to the present study for 16 +/- 4 years; (2) group B included
	11 asthmatic patients (three women; mean age, 64 +/- 11 years) with
	moderate persistent asthma (FEV(1) of 60 to 80\% predicted) with
	serial FEV(1) measurements for 12 +/- 4 years; and (3) group C included
	5 asthmatic patients (three women; mean age, 55 +/- 16 years) with
	severe persistent asthma (FEV(1) < 60\% predicted) with serial FEV(1)
	measurements for 11 plus minus 5 years. RESULTS: Lung CT indicated
	no or trivial emphysema, and diffusion was normal in all asthmatics.
	There was a marked loss of lung elastic recoil at total lung capacity
	(TLC) in all asthmatic patients in group B (16 +/- 4 cm H(2)O) and
	group C (15 +/- 5 cm H(2)O), but none or minimal in group A (22 +/-
	1 cm H(2)O) [p < 0.01], and loss of elastic recoil accounted for
	34\% and 50\% of decreased maximal expiratory airflow (max) at 80\%
	and 70\% TLC, respectively. Comparison with previous longitudinal
	data indicated individual asthmatics when in clinically stable condition
	remained predominantly in the same FEV(1) percent predicted classification
	group as in the current study. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic
	moderate and severe persistent asthma, despite optimal therapy, have
	reduced max for many years in part due to (early?) loss of lung elastic
	recoil from unknown mechanism(s). This challenges current concept
	of airway remodeling.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The assessment of return of function within dysfunctional
	myocardium after acute myocardial infarction (MI) using contractile
	reserve has been primarily qualitative. Magnetic resonance (MR) myocardial
	tagging is a novel noninvasive method that measures intramyocardial
	function. We hypothesized that MR tagging could be used to quantify
	the intramyocardial response to low-dose dobutamine and relate this
	response to return of function in patients after first MI. METHODS
	AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with a first reperfused MI (age, 53+/-12
	years; 16 male; 11 inferior MIs) were studied. Patients underwent
	breath-hold MR-tagged short-axis imaging on day 4+/-2 after MI at
	baseline and during dobutamine infusion at 5 and 10 microg x kg(-1)
	x min(-1). At 8+/-1 weeks after MI, patients returned for a follow-up
	MR tagging study without dobutamine. Quantification of percent intramyocardial
	circumferential segment shortening (\%S) was performed. Low-dose
	dobutamine MRI was well tolerated. Overall, mean \%S was 15+/-11\%
	at baseline (n=227 segments), increased to 16+/-10\% at 5 microg
	x kg(-1) x min(-1) dobutamine (P=NS), 21+/-10\% at peak (P<0.0001
	versus baseline and 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), and 18+/-10\% at
	8 weeks (P<0.004 versus baseline and peak). The increase in \%S with
	peak dobutamine was greater in dysfunctional myocardium (103 segments,
	+9+/-10\%) than in normal tissue (124 segments, +4+/-12\%, P<0.0001).
	In dysfunctional regions, \%S also increased from 6+/-7\% at baseline
	to 14+/-10\% at 8 weeks after MI (P<0.0001). In dysfunctional regions
	that responded normally to peak dobutamine (> or =5\% increase in
	\%S), the increase in \%S from baseline to 8 weeks after MI (+9+/-9\%)
	was greater than in those regions that did not respond normally (+5+/-9\%,
	P<0.04). Midmyocardial and subepicardial response to dobutamine were
	predictive of functional recovery, but the subendocardial response
	was not. CONCLUSIONS: The response of intramyocardial function to
	low-dose dobutamine after reperfused MI can be quantified with MR
	tagging. Dysfunctional tissue after MI demonstrates a larger contractile
	response to dobutamine than normal myocardium. A normal increase
	in shortening elicited by dobutamine within dysfunctional midwall
	and subepicardium predicts greater functional recovery at 8 weeks
	after MI, but the response within the subendocardium is not predictive.},

	without added contrast is presented. Three cases with 4D CT images
	obtained with respiratory gated acquisition for radiotherapy treatment
	planning were selected. Each of the 4D CT data sets was acquired
	during resting tidal breathing. A deformable image registration algorithm
	mapped each (voxel) corresponding tissue element across the 4D CT
	data set. From local average CT values, the change in fraction of
	air per voxel (i.e. local ventilation) was calculated. A 4D ventilation

	image volume, first the exhalation then the inhalation phases representing
	a complete breath cycle. A preliminary validation using manually
	determined lung volumes was performed. The calculated total ventilation
	was compared to the change in contoured lung volumes between the
	CT pairs (measured volume). A linear regression resulted in a slope
	of 1.01 and a correlation coefficient of 0.984 for the ventilation
	images. The spatial distribution of ventilation was found to be case
	specific and a 30\% difference in mass-specific ventilation between

  abstract = {The accuracy of image-guided neurosurgery generally suffers from brain
	deformations due to intraoperative changes. These deformations cause
	significant changes of the anatomical geometry (organ shape and spatial
	interorgan relations), thus making intraoperative navigation based
	on preoperative images error prone. In order to improve the navigation
	accuracy, we developed a biomechanical model of the human head based
	on the finite element method, which can be employed for the correction
	of preoperative images to cope with the deformations occurring during
	surgical interventions. At the current stage of development, the
	two-dimensional (2-D) implementation of the model comprises two different
	materials, though the theory holds for the three-dimensional (3-D)
	case and is capable of dealing with an arbitrary number of different
	materials. For the correction of a preoperative image, a set of homologous
	landmarks must be specified which determine correspondences. These
	correspondences can be easily integrated into the model and are maintained
	throughout the computation of the deformation of the preoperative
	image. The necessary material parameter values have been determined
	through a comprehensive literature study. Our approach has been tested
	for the case of synthetic images and yields physically plausible
	deformation results. Additionally, we carried out registration experiments
	with a preoperative MR image of the human head and a corresponding
	postoperative image simulating an intraoperative image. We found
	that our approach yields good prediction results, even in the case
	when correspondences are given in a relatively small area of the

	have been proposed, no work has been done, as far as we know, to
	evaluate and objectively compare the performances of different nonrigid
	(or elastic) registration methods on the same database of subjects.
	In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework, based on global
	and local measures of the relevance of the registration. We have
	chosen to focus more particularly on the matching of cortical areas,
	since intersubject registration methods are dedicated to anatomical
	and functional normalization, and also because other groups have
	shown the relevance of such registration methods for deep brain structures.
	Experiments were conducted using 6 methods on a database of 18 subjects.
	The global measures used show that the quality of the registration
	is directly related to the transformation's degrees of freedom. More
	surprisingly, local measures based on the matching of cortical sulci
	did not show significant differences between rigid and non rigid
	methods.},

  abstract = {To assess awareness and understanding of obstructive airway diseases
	by primary-care physicians, the authors surveyed a randomly selected
	population of 75 primary care practitioners. During one-on-one interviews,
	physicians were presented with a standardized case scenario and a
	subsequent series of open-ended questions concerning asthma and COPD.
	Each respondent was presented in randomized fashion with one of two
	versions of a case description of a hypothetical 52-year-old male
	smoker with a recent upper respiratory tract infection and persistent
	productive cough. The only difference between case descriptions was
	that one included explicit reference to an earlier tentative diagnosis
	of chronic bronchitis (CB version); the other description made no
	specific mention of this diagnostic term (NCB version). Chest radiographs
	were requested by 80 percent of physicians and sputum cultures by
	50 percent, these percentages not differing significantly between
	CB and NCB groups. Spirometry was requested less often than either
	of the foregoing tests (21 percent). The CB group requested spirometry
	significantly more often than the NCB group (38 percent vs 5 percent,
	p < 0.05). The most frequently mentioned primary diagnosis was bronchitis/pneumonia
	(33 percent), followed by bronchitis (28 percent) and chronic bronchitis
	(16 percent), all of which were similar in both groups. However,
	the diagnostic term "COPD" was the primary diagnosis in 16 percent
	of the CB group, compared with 8 percent in the NCB group (p > 0.05).
	Oral antibiotics were the most frequently chosen first-line drug
	therapy (63 percent). In subsequent questions concerning the management
	of obstructive airway diseases, primary practitioners distinguished
	COPD from asthma conceptually, but their prescribed therapy for the
	two disorders was less distinct. beta 2-agonists were selected most
	frequently and similarly as initial therapy for both disorders (53
	percent). Minor differences between first-line therapeutic choices
	included nonsignificant trends toward the more frequent mention of
	anticholinergic bronchodilators for COPD than for asthma (10 percent
	vs 0 percent) and the more frequent selection of inhaled corticosteroids
	for asthma (12 percent vs 5 percent). The authors conclude that to
	the extent that questionnaire responses reflect actual practice,
	primary care practitioners (1) have a low index of suspicion for
	obstructive airway disease, (2) markedly underutilized spirometry
	as a screening tool, (3) consider beta 2-agonists first-line therapy
	for COPD and asthma, and (4) despite considering COPD and asthma
	different disease processes, choose similar medications for each
	disorder.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate
	their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular,
	comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological
	data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences
	across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration
	of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures,
	so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains
	to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
	deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted.
	Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
	using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations
	between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including:
	AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO,
	SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular
	Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All
	of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between
	the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings
	of this study is that the relative performances of the registration
	methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice
	of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure.
	This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable
	to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different
	labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according
	to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
	ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost
	identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's
	DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance
	measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high
	accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published
	on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

	cystic fibrosis (CF) with quantitative analysis of dynamic hyperpolarized
	(HP) (3)He MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic radial projection
	MRI of HP (3)He gas was used to study respiratory dynamics in a group
	of eight children with CF. Signal kinetics in a total of seven regions
	of interest (ROIs; three in each lung, and one in the trachea) were
	compared with the results of spirometric pulmonary function tests
	(PFTs). The tracheal signal intensity was used as a form of "input
	function" to normalize for input flow effects. RESULTS: A pattern
	of low flow rate in the upper lobes was observed. When the flow measurements
	from the peripheral ROIs were averaged to obtain an index of flow
	in the peripheral lung, a good correlation was found (P = 3.74 x
	10(-5)) with the forced expired volume in one second (FEV1). CONCLUSION:
	These results suggest that a quantitative measurement of localized
	airways obstruction in the early stages of CF may be obtained from
	dynamic (3)He MRI by using the slope of the signal rise as a measure
	of air flow into the peripheral lung. This study also demonstrates
	that children can cooperate well with the (3)He MRI technique.},

	artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred eleven consecutive
	patients with chest pain underwent dobutamine-CMR 4 days after antianginal
	medication was stopped. Dobutamine-CMR was performed at rest and
	during increasing doses of dobutamine. Cine-images were acquired
	during breath-hold with and without myocardial tagging at 3 short-axis
	levels. Regional wall motion was assessed in a 16-segment short-axis
	model. Patients with new wall motion abnormalities (NWMA) were examined
	by coronary angiography. Dobutamine-CMR was successfully performed
	in 194 patients. Dobutamine-CMR without tagging detected NWMA in
	58 patients, whereas NWMA were detected in 68 patients with tagging
	(P=0.002, McNemar). Coronary angiography showed coronary artery disease
	in 65 (96\%) of these 68 patients. All but 3 of the 65 patients needed
	revascularization. In the 112 patients with a negative dobutamine-CMR
	study, without baseline wall motion abnormalities, the cardiovascular
	occurrence-free survival rate was 98.2\% during the mean follow-up
	period of 17.3 months (range, 7 to 31). CONCLUSIONS: Dobutamine-CMR
	with myocardial tagging detected more NWMA compared with dobutamine-CMR
	without tagging and reliably separated patients with a normal life
	expectancy from those at increased risk of major adverse cardiac

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate characterization of asthma severity is difficult
	due to the variability of symptoms. Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI (H(3)HeMR)
	is a new technique in which the airspaces are visualized, depicting
	regions with airflow obstruction as "ventilation defects." The objective
	of this study was to compare the extent of H(3)HeMR ventilation defects
	with measures of asthma severity and spirometry. METHODS: Patients
	with a physician diagnosis of asthma and normal control subjects
	underwent H(3)HeMR. For each person, the number and size of ventilation
	defects were scored and the average number of ventilation defects
	per slice (VDS) was calculated. The correlations of the imaging findings
	with measures of asthma severity and spirometry were determined.
	RESULTS: There were 58 patients with asthma (mild-intermittent, n
	= 13; mild-persistent, n = 13; moderate-persistent, n = 20; and severe-persistent,
	n = 12) and 18 control subjects. Mean +/- SE VDS for asthmatics was
	significantly greater than for control subjects (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs
	0.26 +/- 0.22, p = 0.004). Among asthmatics, VDS was significantly
	higher for the group with moderate-persistent and severe-persistent
	disease than for the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent
	disease (1.37 +/- 0.24 vs 0.53 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001). VDS correlated
	significantly with FEV(1)/FVC (r = - 0.51, p = 0.002), forced expiratory
	flow between 25\% and 75\% from the beginning of FVC (FEF(25-75\%))
	percentage of predicted for height, sex, and race (\%predicted) [r
	= - 0.50, p = 0.001], and FEV(1) \%predicted (r = - 0.40, p = 0.002),
	but not with FVC \%predicted (r = - 0.26, p = 0.057) and peak expiratory
	flow \%predicted (r = - 0.16, p = 0.231). Many asthmatics had an
	elevated VDS, but their spirometric indexes, except FEF(25\%-75\%),
	were normal. Most ventilation defects were < 3 cm in size for all
	asthmatics. In the group of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent
	asthma, there were more defects > or =3 cm than in the group with
	mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS:
	Regional changes of airflow obstruction in asthmatics depicted by

	within the lungs of patients with asthma vary or are fixed in location
	with time or repeated bronchoconstriction. With hyperpolarized helium-3
	magnetic resonance (H(3)HeMR) imaging, the airspaces are depicted
	and focal areas of airflow obstruction are shown as "ventilation
	defects." OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional changes of airflow
	obstruction with time and repeated bronchoconstriction. METHODS:
	H(3)HeMR and spirometry were performed before (pre) and immediately
	after (post) methacholine challenge in 10 young patients with asthma
	on 2 days that were 7-476 days (mean, 185.3 +/- 37.2 days) apart.
	Pair-wise image comparisons were performed to determine the change
	in location of ventilation defects within the lung and their change
	in size. RESULTS: When comparing premethacholine versus premethacholine
	and postmethacholine versus post-methacholine images of the 2 days,
	41\% +/- 10\% and 69\% +/- 5\% (P = .017) of defects, respectively,
	were in the same location, and of those, 69\% +/- 12\% and 43\% +/-
	5\% (P = .022), respectively, did not change size. Comparing premethacholine
	versus postmethacholine images, 58\% +/- 9\% of defects were in the
	same location on day 1 and 73\% +/- 7\% (P = .088) on day 2. On both
	days, the percent increase in defect number from premethacholine
	to postmethacholine was much greater than the percent decrease in
	spirometric values (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Many of the ventilation
	defects persisted or recurred in the same location with time or repeated
	bronchoconstriction, suggesting that the regional changes of airflow
	obstruction are relatively fixed within the lung. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
	The findings give new insight into the regional airflow variability

	handle multichannel data and slice-by-slice constant intensity offsets,
	is initialized with information from a digital brain atlas about
	the a priori expected location of tissue classes. This allows full
	automation of the method without need for user interaction, yielding

	Spirometry is expressed as percent predicted. There were four men

	subjects and determine whether HHe MR can detect changes after bronchodilator
	therapy or mechanical airway mucus clearance treatment. MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: Thirty-one subjects, 16 healthy volunteers and 15 patients
	with CF, underwent HHe lung ventilation MR imaging and spirometry
	at baseline. Eight patients with CF then were treated with nebulized
	albuterol, after which a follow-up HHe MR scan was obtained. Subsequently,
	recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment and chest physical
	therapy were performed in these eight subjects, followed by a third
	HHe MR scan. For each MR study, the number of ventilation defects
	was scored by a human reader. RESULTS: Patients with CF had significantly
	more HHe MR ventilation defects per image than healthy subjects (mean,
	8.2 defects in patients with CF vs 1.6 defects in healthy subjects;
	P < .05). Even the four subjects with CF with a normal forced expiratory
	volume in 1 second had significantly more ventilation defects than
	healthy subjects (mean, 6.5 defects in these patients with CF; P
	= .0002). After treatment with albuterol, there was a small, but
	statistically significant, decrease in number of ventilation defects
	(mean, 9.6-8.0 defects; P = .025). After DNase and chest physical
	therapy, there was a trend toward increasing ventilation defects
	(mean, 8.3 defects; P = .096), but with a residual net improvement
	relative to baseline. CONCLUSION: In patients with CF, HHe MR ventilation
	defects correlate with spirometry, change with treatment, and are
	elevated in number in patients with CF with normal spirometry results.
	Thus, HHe MR appears to possess many of the characteristics required
	of a biomarker for pulmonary CF and may be useful in the evaluation
	of CF pulmonary disease severity or progression.},

	helium-3 (He-3) MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bronchoconstriction was
	induced in 11 healthy rats using an intravenous injection of methacholine.
	The He-3 was laser-polarized using a custom-built system. MRI studies
	were performed on a 2-Tesla bore magnet. Coronal dynamic ventilation
	images were obtained using a single inhalation of the laser-polarized
	He-3 gas before and after methacholine injection. Ventilation image
	series were processed on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate three
	regional ventilation parameters: gas flow rate, filling time, and
	maximum gas volume. Student's paired t-test was used for analysis.
	RESULTS: Ventilation image series with a temporal resolution of 5
	msec were obtained before and after methacholine challenge. Quantitative
	regional gas dynamic information demonstrated statistically significant
	differences between the baseline and constricted states. Following
	methacholine injection, the mean flow values were significantly lower
	for the right lung (RL) (P = 0.006) and left lung (LL) (P = 0.024),
	while the mean filling time was found to be greater (RL: P = 0.08,
	LL: P = 0.021). Gas volume values at maximum inspiration were found
	to be significantly lower after methacholine (RL: P = 0.002; LL:
	P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: He-3 MRI demonstrated and quantified regional
	ventilation changes in bronchoconstriction conditions in rats.},

	axisymmetric geometry that enabled us to calculate pressures in <2
	min on a Sun Ultra SPARC 10 workstation. To determine the effects
	of vascular stenoses, we fabricated several stenotic phantom geometries
	(with 50\%, 75\%, and 90\% area stenoses), and performed both MRI
	and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for various flow
	rates for these phantom geometries. Noise with Gaussian statistics
	was added to the velocity field obtained from the CFD simulations.
	The pressure maps obtained directly from CFD simulations for our
	phantom geometries were compared with pressure maps derived by our
	algorithm when 1) the input was noise-corrupted velocity data from
	CFD, and 2) the input was PC-MRI data collected from the phantoms.
	The quantitative effects of noise, resolution, and flow rate on the
	accuracy of pressure measurements were determined. We found that
	for flow rates below the Reynolds number for turbulent flow, resolution
	is a more significant determinant of accuracy than SNR. Furthermore,
	if other parameters remain constant, increased flow rates may result
	in decreased accuracy.},

	computed tomography (QCT) could separate asthmatic patients from
	normal control subjects. The QCT results were also correlated with
	the pulmonary function tests (PFT) that were done on both the asthmatic
	patients and control subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen adult
	nonsmoking asthmatics and 22 adult control subjects were entered
	into the study. Quantitative CT was performed at the level of the
	transverse aorta and just above the diaphragm at both end inspiration
	and end expiration in all patients and control subjects: 10-mm and
	1.5-mm collimation using a high spatial frequency algorithm was used
	to obtain the QCT examinations. The percent of pixels below -900
	Hounsfeld units, pixel index, in each of the QCT axial images of
	the lungs was calculated for each asthmatic and control subject in
	the study. Pulmonary function testing was performed on both the asthmatics
	and control subjects and included determination of FEV1, FVC, FRC,
	RV, and TLC. Unpaired Student's t test analysis of the QCT data was
	done to statistically compare the asthmatics with the control subjects.
	Linear regression analysis was done to compare the QCT results with
	PFT data on the asthmatics and control subjects. RESULTS: When scans
	were performed at end expiration, at a level immediately superior
	to the diaphragm, the mean pixel index was significantly higher in
	asthmatic subjects compared with normal individuals on both CT (mean
	for normal subjects 0.16 vs 4.45 for asthmatics, p < 0.004) and high-resolution
	CT (HRCT) images (mean for normal subjects 1.04 vs 10.03 in asthmatics,
	p < 0.0001) indicating more areas of low attenuation in asthmatics.
	The CT and HRCT images from the lower lung zones that were performed
	at end expiration provided the best separation between the groups.
	The pixel index on expiration correlated with the degree of air trapping
	and airflow limitation in the asthmatic group based on FEV1, FRC,
	RV, and to a lesser extent, FVC. CONCLUSION: Expiratory QCT is a
	useful method to assess air trapping in asthmatic patients. The percent
	of abnormal lung in asthmatics as determined by QCT has a significant
	correlation with the PFTs that reflect air trapping in asthmatic
	patients. Quantitative CT may be helpful in assessing degrees of
	air trapping present in other diseases affecting the airways.},

	data were used to fit an analytical series expression to describe
	3D displacement as a function of deformed position. The technique
	was demonstrated with computer-generated models of the deformed left

	deformations were reconstructed with a 3D tracking error of less

	displacements along the tags in 10 human subjects was 0.00 mm +/-
	0.36 (mean +/- standard deviation). Robustness to noise in the tag

	We call the calculated angle of the complex image corresponding to
	one of these peaks a harmonic phase (HARP) image and show that HARP
	images can be used to synthesize conventional tag lines, reconstruct
	displacement fields for small motions, and calculate two-dimensional
	(2-D) strain. The performance of this new approach is demonstrated

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: Hyperpolarized He magnetic resonance imaging (He MRI)
	at 3.0 Tesla of healthy volunteers and chronic obstructive pulmonary
	disease (COPD) patients was performed for quantitative evaluation
	of ventilation defects and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC)
	and for comparison to published results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. The
	reproducibility of He ADC and ventilation defects was also assessed
	in subjects scanned 3 times, twice within 10 minutes, and again within
	7 +/- 2 days of the first MRI visit. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Hyperpolarized
	He MRI was performed in 6 subjects. Two interleaved images with and
	without additional diffusion sensitization were acquired with the
	first image serving as a ventilation image from which defect score
	and volume were measured and the combination of the 2 images used
	to compute ADC maps and ADC histograms. RESULTS:: He MRI at 3.0 Tesla
	showed increased mean ADC and ADC standard deviation for subjects
	with COPD compared with healthy volunteers (ADC healthy volunteer
	(0.24 +/- 0.12 cm/s), mild-moderate COPD (0.34 +/- 0.14 cm/s), and
	severe COPD (0.47 +/- 0.21 cm/s), and these values were similar to
	previously reported results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. Reproducibility
	of mean ADC was high (coefficient of variation 2\% in severe COPD,
	3\% in mild-moderate COPD, 4\% in healthy volunteers) across all
	3 scans. Higher same-day scan reproducibility was observed for ventilation
	defect volume compared with 1-week scan reproducibility in this small
	group of subjects. CONCLUSIONS:: ADC values for emphysematous lungs
	were significantly increased compared with healthy lungs in age-matched
	subjects, and all values were comparable to those reported previously
	at 1.5 Tesla. Ventilation defect score and ventilation defect volume
	results were also comparable to results previously reported in COPD
	subjects Reproducibility of ADC for same-day scan-rescan and 7-day
	rescan was high and similar to previously reported results.},

	a "gold-standard" registration which has been accurately calculated

	a computed tomography (CT) scan of a spine phantom to a fluoroscopy
	image of the phantom. The registration is carried out within a region-of-interest
	in the fluoroscopy image which is user defined to contain a single
	vertebra. Many of the problems involved in this type of registration
	are caused by features which were not modeled by a phantom image
	alone. More realistic "gold-standard" data sets were simulated using
	the phantom image with clinical image features overlaid. Results
	show that the introduction of soft-tissue structures and interventional
	instruments into the phantom image can have a large effect on the
	performance of some similarity measures previously applied to 2-D-3-D
	image registration. Two measures were able to register accurately
	and robustly even when soft-tissue structures and interventional
	instruments were present as differences between the images. These
	measures were pattern intensity and gradient difference. Their registration
	accuracy, for all the rigid-body parameters except for the source
	to film translation, was within a root-mean-square (rms) error of
	0.54 mm or degrees to the "gold-standard" values. No failures occurred
	while registering using these measures.},

  abstract = {A measure for registration of medical images that currently draws
	much attention is mutual information. The measure originates from
	information theory, but has been shown to be successful for image
	registration as well. Information theory, however, offers many more
	measures that may be suitable for image registration. These all measure
	the divergence of the joint distribution of the images' grey values
	from the joint distribution that would have been found had the images
	been completely independent. This paper compares the performance
	of mutual information as a registration measure with that of other
	F-information measures. The measures are applied to rigid registration
	of positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) and
	MR/computed tomography (CT) images, for 35 and 41 image pairs, respectively.
	An accurate gold standard transformation is available for the images,
	based on implanted markers. The registration performance, robustness
	and accuracy of the measures are studied. Some of the measures are
	shown to perform poorly on all aspects. The majority of measures
	produces results similar to those of mutual information. An important
	finding, however, is that several measures, although slightly more
	difficult to optimize, can potentially yield significantly more accurate
	results than mutual information.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we extend a previously reported intensity-based nonrigid
	registration algorithm by using a novel regularization term to constrain
	the deformation. Global motion is modeled by a rigid transformation
	while local motion is described by a free-form deformation based
	on B-splines. An information theoretic measure, normalized mutual
	information, is used as an intensity-based image similarity measure.
	Registration is performed by searching for the deformation that minimizes
	a cost function consisting of a weighted combination of the image
	similarity measure and a regularization term. The novel regularization
	term is a local volume-preservation (incompressibility) constraint,
	which is motivated by the assumption that soft tissue is incompressible
	for small deformations and short time periods. The incompressibility
	constraint is implemented by penalizing deviations of the Jacobian
	determinant of the deformation from unity. We apply the nonrigid
	registration algorithm with and without the incompressibility constraint
	to precontrast and post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) breast images
	from 17 patients. Without using a constraint, the volume of contrast-enhancing
	lesions decreases by 1\%-78\% (mean 26\%). Image improvement (motion
	artifact reduction) obtained using the new constraint is compared
	with that obtained using a smoothness constraint based on the bending
	energy of the coordinate grid by blinded visual assessment of maximum
	intensity projections of subtraction images. For both constraints,
	volume preservation improves, and motion artifact correction worsens,
	as the weight of the constraint penalty term increases. For a given
	volume change of the contrast-enhancing lesions (2\% of the original
	volume), the incompressibility constraint reduces motion artifacts
	better than or equal to the smoothness constraint in 13 out of 17
	cases (better in 9, equal in 4, worse in 4). The preliminary results
	suggest that incorporation of the incompressibility regularization
	term improves intensity-based free-form nonrigid registration of
	contrast-enhanced MR breast images by greatly reducing the problem
	of shrinkage of contrast-enhancing structures while simultaneously
	allowing motion artifacts to be substantially reduced.},

	This approach is an extension of the original interpolating thin-plate

	landmark extraction is always prone to error. Our approach is based
	on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as

	is possible to include different types of landmarks, e.g., unique
	point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme
	is general with respect to the image dimension and the order of smoothness
	of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well
	as interpolating thin-plate splines are special cases of this scheme.
	To localize landmarks we use a semi-automatic approach which is based
	on three-dimensional (3-D) differential operators. Experimental results
	are presented for two-dimensional as well as 3-D tomographic images

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging of gas distribution in the lungs of patients with
	asthma has been restricted because of the lack of a suitable gaseous
	contrast agent. Hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe3) provides a new technique
	for magnetic resonance imaging of lung diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought
	to investigate the use of HHe3 gas to image the lungs of patients
	with moderate or severe asthma and to assess changes in gas distribution
	after methacholine and exercise challenge. METHODS: Magnetic resonance
	imaging was performed in asthmatic patients immediately after inhalation
	of HHe3 gas. In addition, images were obtained before and after methacholine
	challenge and a standard exercise test. RESULTS: Areas of the lung
	with no signal or sharply reduced HHe3 signal (ventilation defects)
	are common in patients with asthma, and the number of defects was
	inversely related to the percent predicted FEV(1) (r = 0.71, P <.002).
	After methacholine challenge (n = 3), the number of defects increased.
	Similarly, imaging of the lungs after exercise (n = 6) showed increased
	ventilation defects in parallel with decreases in FEV(1). The increase
	in defects after challenge in these 9 asthmatic patients was significant
	both for the number (P <.02) and extent (P <.02) of the defects.
	The variability and speed of changes in ventilation and the complete
	lack of signal in many areas is in keeping with a model in which
	the defects result from airway closure. CONCLUSION: HHe3 magnetic
	resonance provides a new technique for imaging the distribution of
	inhaled air in the lungs. The technique is suitable for following
	responses to treatment of asthma and changes after methacholine or
	exercise challenge.},

	image registration. This method is based on the simulation of physically
	plausible, biomechanical tissue deformations using finite-element
	methods. Applying a range of displacements to finite-element models
	of different patient anatomies generates model solutions which simulate
	gold standard deformations. From these solutions, deformed images
	are generated with a range of deformations typical of those likely
	to occur in vivo. The registration accuracy with respect to the finite-element
	simulations is quantified by co-registering the deformed images with
	the original images and comparing the recovered voxel displacements
	with the biomechanically simulated ones. The functionality of the
	validation method is demonstrated for a previously described nonrigid
	image registration technique based on free-form deformations using
	B-splines and normalized mutual information as a voxel similarity
	measure, with an application to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
	mammography image pairs. The exemplar nonrigid registration technique
	is shown to be of subvoxel accuracy on average for this particular
	application. The validation method presented here is an important
	step toward more generic simulations of biomechanically plausible
	tissue deformations and quantification of tissue motion recovery
	using nonrigid image registration. It will provide a basis for improving
	and comparing different nonrigid registration techniques for a diversity
	of medical applications, such as intrasubject tissue deformation
	or motion correction in the brain, liver or heart.},

	over two independent quantities that are intrinsic to the deformation:
	its divergence, and its curl. Our algorithm is also able to handle
	soft landmark constraints, which is particularly useful when parts

	is uneven. We provide an optimal analytical solution in the case
	when only landmarks and smoothness considerations are taken into

	standardized procedure for the measurement of regional fractional
	ventilation in a healthy rat model as a baseline for further studies
	of pulmonary disorder models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lungs of
	five healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were imaged using hyperpolarized
	helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging. From these images, regional
	fractional ventilation was calculated and maps generated detailing
	the distribution of fractional ventilation in the lung. The 1.56
	mm x 1.56 mm x 4 mm regions of interest were assigned on 5 cm x 5
	cm field of view lung maps. Histograms were also generated showing
	the frequency distribution of fractional ventilation values. To compare
	fractional ventilation values between animals, the ventilation procedure
	was standardized to results from individual pulmonary function tests.
	Each animal's spontaneous tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspiration
	percentage (percent of total respiratory cycle in inspiration) were
	used in their mechanical ventilation settings. RESULTS: Results were
	similar among all five healthy rats based on examination of ventilation
	distribution maps and frequency distribution histograms. Mean (0.13)
	and standard deviation (0.07) were calculated for fractional ventilation
	in each animal. However, these values were determined to be influenced
	by slice selection, and therefore the maps and histograms were favored
	in analysis of results. CONCLUSION: This study shows consistent results
	in healthy rat lungs and will serve as a baseline study for future
	measurements in emphysematous rat lungs.},

	Many diseases mimic asthma and these alternate diagnoses should be

	bursts or chronic daily therapy with oral corticosteroids. These
	patients may have "resistant" inflammation with a persistent inflammatory
	state. Numerous studies also suggest that compliance with asthma
	therapy is poor. Combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids
	and long-acting beta(2)-agonist in a single inhaler may improve patient
	compliance. In selected patients, additional therapy with leukotriene
	modifiers or anti-IgE antibody can result in improved asthma control
	and may allow tapering of corticosteroids. Use of methotrexate is
	not justified based on current data. Emerging evidence suggests that
	different phenotypes of difficult or therapy-resistant asthma exist.
	Recognition of these subgroups allows tailored therapy and prevents
	overmedication in an attempt to normalize lung function in patients
	with irreversible airflow obstruction.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to the correction of intensity
	inhomogeneities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that significantly
	improves intensity-based tissue segmentation. The distortion of the
	image brightness values by a low-frequency bias field impedes visual
	inspection and segmentation. The new correction method called parametric
	bias field correction (PABIC) is based on a simplified model of the
	imaging process, a parametric model of tissue class statistics, and
	a polynomial model of the inhomogeneity field. We assume that the
	image is composed of pixels assigned to a small number of categories
	with a priori known statistics. Further we assume that the image
	is corrupted by noise and a low-frequency inhomogeneity field. The
	estimation of the parametric bias field is formulated as a nonlinear
	energy minimization problem using an evolution strategy (ES). The
	resulting bias field is independent of the image region configurations
	and thus overcomes limitations of methods based on homomorphic filtering.
	Furthermore, PABIC can correct bias distortions much larger than
	the image contrast. Input parameters are the intensity statistics
	of the classes and the degree of the polynomial function. The polynomial
	approach combines bias correction with histogram adjustment, making
	it well suited for normalizing the intensity histogram of datasets
	from serial studies. We present simulations and a quantitative validation
	with phantom and test images. A large number of MR image data acquired
	with breast, surface, and head coils, both in two dimensions and
	three dimensions, have been processed and demonstrate the versatility
	and robustness of this new bias correction scheme.},

	dynamic breathing magnetic resonance imaging (BMRI) was acquired
	with fast-gradient echo pulse sequences at fixed thoracic planes
	over two to three slow, deep respiratory cycles in 6 controls and
	28 patients with pulmonary emphysema including 9 patients undergoing
	lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Respiratory motions of the
	diaphragm and chest wall (D/CW) were assessed by a cine-loop view,
	a fusion display of maximal inspiratory and expiratory images, and
	the time-distance curves. By contrast with normal subjects with regular
	synchronous D/CW motions, the patients frequently showed reduced,
	irregular, or asynchronous motions, with significant decreases in
	the maximal amplitude of D/CW motions (MAD and MACW), and the length
	of apposition of the diaphragm (LAD) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, P <
	0. 01, respectively). After LVRS, nine patients showed improvements
	in D/CW configuration and mobility, with significantly increased
	MAD, MACW, and LAD (P < 0.01, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.05, respectively).
	In 40 studies of 28 patients including the post-LVRS examinations,

	(r = 0. 881 and r = 0.906; P < 0.0001, respectively). BMRI seems

  abstract = {This paper describes the design, implementation and preliminary results
	of a technique for creating a comprehensive probabilistic atlas of
	the human brain based on high-dimensional vector field transformations.
	The goal of the atlas is to detect and quantify distributed patterns
	of deviation from normal anatomy, in a 3-D brain image from any given
	subject. The algorithm analyzes a reference population of normal
	scans and automatically generates color-coded probability maps of
	the anatomy of new subjects. Given a 3-D brain image of a new subject,
	the algorithm calculates a set of high-dimensional volumetric maps
	(with typically 384(2) x 256 x 3 approximately 10(8) degrees of freedom)
	elastically deforming this scan into structural correspondence with
	other scans, selected one by one from an anatomic image database.
	The family of volumetric warps thus constructed encodes statistical
	properties and directional biases of local anatomical variation throughout
	the architecture of the brain. A probability space of random transformations,
	based on the theory of anisotropic Gaussian random fields, is then
	developed to reflect the observed variability in stereotaxic space
	of the points whose correspondences are found by the warping algorithm.
	A complete system of 384(2) x 256 probability density functions is
	computed, yielding confidence limits in stereotaxic space for the
	location of every point represented in the 3-D image lattice of the
	new subject's brain. Color-coded probability maps are generated,
	densely defined throughout the anatomy of the new subject. These
	indicate locally the probability of each anatomic point being unusually
	situated, given the distributions of corresponding points in the
	scans of normal subjects. 3-D MRI and high-resolution cryosection
	volumes are analyzed from subjects with metastatic tumors and Alzheimer's
	disease. Gradual variations and continuous deformations of the underlying
	anatomy are simulated and their dynamic effects on regional probability
	maps are animated in video format (on the accompanying CD-ROM). Applications
	of the deformable probabilistic atlas include the transfer of multi-subject
	3-D functional, vascular and histologic maps onto a single anatomic
	template, the mapping of 3-D atlases onto the scans of new subjects,
	and the rapid detection, quantification and mapping of local shape
	changes in 3-D medical images in disease and during normal or abnormal
	growth and development.},

  abstract = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation
	is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using
	volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational
	B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for
	the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models--one with a
	cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal
	parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e.,
	prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate
	spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices
	were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each
	frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by
	fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding
	set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric
	model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of
	orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line
	intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve
	for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares
	sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole
	using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid
	registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later
	time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points,
	the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create
	a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model,
	we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and
	corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local
	measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case
	of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the
	cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform
	their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity
	associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter
	assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations. Lagrangian
	strains in three canine data, a normal human, and a patient with
	history of myocardial infarction are presented. Eulerian strains
	for the normal human data are also included.},

  abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software
	communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting
	technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed
	by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting
	approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration
	techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically,
	these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form
	deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered
	is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline
	object describes the transformation of the image registration solution.
	Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within
	the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed
	cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast
	deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental
	novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as
	well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization
	methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization
	retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution.
	The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the
	observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible
	to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient
	used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood
	preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This
	is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation
	experimentation.},

  abstract = {Current research investigating the modeling of left ventricular dynamics

	Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which
	allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images,
	providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue
	deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing
	a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent
	determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method
	entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed
	times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces
	for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's
	spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement
	field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear,
	and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct,
	the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal
	tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be
	determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows
	for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle
	in 3-D.},

	of this paper, we show that Thirion's demons algorithm can be seen
	as an optimization procedure on the entire space of displacement
	fields. We provide strong theoretical roots to the different variants
	of Thirion's demons algorithm. This analysis predicts a theoretical
	advantage for the symmetric forces variant of the demons algorithm.
	We show on controlled experiments that this advantage is confirmed
	in practice and yields a faster convergence. In the second part of
	this paper, we adapt the optimization procedure underlying the demons
	algorithm to a space of diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast
	to many diffeomorphic registration algorithms, our solution is computationally
	efficient since in practice it only replaces an addition of displacement
	fields by a few compositions. Our experiments show that in addition
	to being diffeomorphic, our algorithm provides results that are similar
	to the ones from the demons algorithm but with transformations that
	are much smoother and closer to the gold standard, available in controlled
	experiments, in terms of Jacobians.},

  abstract = {It is not known whether sputum elastase, metalloproteinase (MMP)-9
	and tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 are related to structural
	changes of the airways, as assessed by high-resolution computed tomography
	(HRCT) scan. The relationships between these markers and the magnitude
	of structural changes of the airways in asthma and chronic obstructive
	pulmonary disease (COPD) were assessed. Induced sputum and HRCT scan
	were performed in 30 asthmatics (14 mild and 16 severe) and in 12
	patients with COPD. A greater extent of HRCT scan abnormalities was
	found in COPD than in severe and mild asthmatics. HRCT scan abnormalities
	correlated with the degree of airway obstruction in COPD and in severe
	asthma. HRCT scan abnormalities also correlated with the levels of
	sputum elastase both in COPD and in severe asthma. HRCT scan abnormalities
	were associated with sputum MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in mild asthma, severe
	asthma and COPD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that sputum
	elastase and the metalloproteinase-9/tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase-1
	ratio are associated with the magnitude of high-resolution computed
	tomography scan abnormalities of the airways in asthma and chronic
	obstructive pulmonary disease, and suggests that the levels of these
	markers reflect the extent of structural changes of the airways.},

  abstract = {This paper presents processing and visualization techniques for Diffusion
	Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In DT-MRI, each voxel
	is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. The geometric
	nature of diffusion tensors enables us to quantitatively characterize
	the local structure in tissues such as bone, muscle, and white matter
	of the brain. This makes DT-MRI an interesting modality for image
	analysis. In this paper we present a novel analytical solution to
	the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor
	basis, derived from the diffusion sensitizing gradient configuration,
	eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further
	describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical
	properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion
	ellipsoid. A simple anisotropy measure follows naturally from this
	analysis. We describe how the geometry or shape of the tensor can
	be visualized using a coloring scheme based on the derived shape
	measures. In addition, we demonstrate that human brain tensor data
	when filtered can effectively describe macrostructural diffusion,
	which is important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization.
	We also describe how white matter pathways can be monitored with
	the methods introduced in this paper. DT-MRI tractography is useful
	for demonstrating neural connectivity (in vivo) in healthy and diseased
	brain tissue.},

	imaging (MRI) and proton single-shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) to compare
	ventilated lung volumes in groups of "healthy" smokers, smokers diagnosed
	with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and never-smokers.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: All study participants were assessed with
	spirometry prior to imaging. 3-He images were collected during an
	arrested breath hold, after inhaling a mixture of 200 mL of hyperpolarized
	3-He/800 mL of N2. Proton SSFSE images were acquired after inhaling
	1 liter of room air. The ventilated volume for each study participant
	was calculated from the 3-He images, and a ratio was calculated to
	give a percentage ventilated lung volume. RESULTS: Never-smokers
	exhibited a 90\% mean ventilated volume. The mean ventilated lung
	volumes for healthy smokers and smokers diagnosed with COPD were
	75.2\% and 67.6\%, respectively. No correlation with spirometry was
	demonstrated for either of the smoking groups. CONCLUSION: Combined
	3-He/Proton SSFSE MRI of the lungs is a noninvasive method, using
	nonionizing radiation, which demonstrates ventilated airspaces and
	enables the calculation of ventilated lung volumes. This method appears
	to be sensitive to early obstructive changes in the lungs of smokers.},

  abstract = {Active contour segmentation and its robust implementation using level
	set methods are well-established theoretical approaches that have
	been studied thoroughly in the image analysis literature. Despite
	the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of
	clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using
	slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological
	advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application
	called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation
	easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with
	little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods
	and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides
	the results of validation experiments performed in the context of
	an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes
	SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics
	for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable
	and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for
	lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a postprocessing tool to quantify
	ventilated split-lung volumes on the basis of (3)He-MRI and to apply
	it in patients after single-lung transplantation (SLTX). High-resolution
	CT (HRCT) was employed as a reference modality providing split air-filled
	lung volumes. Lung volumes derived from pulmonary function test results
	served as clinical parameters and were used as the "gold standard."
	MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight patients (mean age, 54 years) with emphysema
	and six patients (mean age, 58 years) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
	All patients were evaluated following SLTX. HRCT was performed during
	inspiration (slice thickness, 1 mm; increment, 10 mm). For correlation
	with (3)He-MRI, HRCT images were reconstructed in coronal orientation
	to match the same anatomic levels. Aerated lung was determined by
	threshold-based segmentation of CT. (3)He-MRI was performed on a
	1.5-T scanner using a two-dimensional, fast low-angle shot sequence
	in coronal orientation covering the whole lung after inhalation of
	a 300-mL bolus of hyperpolarized (3)He gas followed by normal room
	air for the rest of the tidal volume. Lung segmentation on (3)He-MRI
	was done using different thresholds. RESULTS: In emphysematous patients,
	(3)He-MRI showed excellent correlation (r = 0.9) with vital capacity,
	while CT correlated (r = 0.8) with total lung capacity. (3)He-MRI
	correlated well with CT (r > 0.8) for grafts and native fibrotic
	lungs. In emphysematous lungs, MRI showed a good correlation (r =
	0.7) with the nonemphysematous lung volume from CT. Increasing thresholds
	in (3)He-MRI reveal differences between aerated and ventilated lung
	areas with a different distribution in emphysema and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS:
	(3)He-MRI is superior to CT in emphysema to demonstrate ventilated
	lung areas that participate in gas exchange. In fibrosis, (3)He-MRI
	and CT have a similar impact. The decrease pattern and the intraindividual
	ratio between ventilation of native and transplanted lungs will have
	to be investigated as a new surrogate for the ventilatory follow-up
	in patients undergoing SLTX.},

  abstract = {Spatial normalization of diffusion tensor images plays a key role
	in voxel-based analysis of white matter (WM) group differences. Currently,
	it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in
	the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate
	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating
	evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an
	ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three
	normalization methods representing the current range of available
	approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy
	(FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional
	normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed
	in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between
	ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization
	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the
	alignment of WM tracts.},
